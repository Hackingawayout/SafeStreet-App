# SafeStreet-App
SafeStreet streamlines road maintenance with AI-powered damage detection. Its mobile app enables image uploads, analyzed by a ViT model to classify damage and assess severity. The system generates a summary, shares it via email, and provides insights via a MERN-based web platform for authorities.
